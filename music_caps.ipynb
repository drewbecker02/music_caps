The guitar plays a descending run in the beginning then plays an arpeggiated chord followed by a double stop hammer on to a higher note and a descending slide followed by a descending chord run. The percussion plays a simple beat using rim shots. The percussion plays in common time. The bass plays only one note on the first count of each bar. The piano plays backing chords. There are no voices in this song. The mood of this song is relaxing. This song can be played in a coffee shop.   \n",

An e-bass is playing the footnote while a piano is playing a major and minor chord progression. A trumpet is playing a loud melody alongside the guitar. All the instruments sound flat and are being played by a keyboard. There are little bongo hits in the background panned to the left side of the speakers.

       "1                                           This song features an electric guitar as the main instrument. The guitar plays a descending run in the beginning then plays an arpeggiated chord followed by a double stop hammer on to a higher note and a descending slide followed by a descending chord run. The percussion plays a simple beat using rim shots. The percussion plays in common time. The bass plays only one note on the first count of each bar. The piano plays backing chords. There are no voices in this song. The mood of this song is relaxing. This song can be played in a coffee shop.   \n",

The recording sounds like it has been recorded in an empty room. This song may be playing, practicing snipping and singing along.   \n",
       "3     This song contains digital drums playing a simple groove along with two guitars. One strumming chords along with the snare the other one playing a melody on top. An e-bass is playing the footnote while a piano is playing a major and minor chord progression. A trumpet is playing a loud melody alongside the guitar. All the instruments sound flat and are being played by a keyboard. There are little bongo hits in the background panned to the left side of the speakers. Apart from the music you can hear eating sounds and a stomach rumbling. This song may be playing for an advertisement.   \n",

A virtual percussive low-to-mid bell sound is playing a melody that resembles a marimba. There is an eerie feeling of flow. This piece could be used in the soundtracks of dystopian sci-fi movies.

It sounds sad and soulful, like something you would hear at Sunday services.   \n",
       "1                                        This song features an electric guitar as the main instrument. The guitar plays a descending run in the beginning then plays an arpeggiated chord followed by a double stop hammer on to a higher note and a descending slide followed by a descending chord run. The percussion plays a simple beat using rim shots. The percussion plays in common time. The bass plays only one note on the first count of each bar. The piano plays backing chords. There are no voices in this song. The mood of this song is relaxing. This song can be played in a coffee shop.   \n",

The recording sounds like it has been recorded in an empty room. This song may be playing, practicing snipping and singing along.   \n",
       "3  This song contains digital drums playing a simple groove along with two guitars. One strumming chords along with the snare the other one playing a melody on top. An e-bass is playing the footnote while a piano is playing a major and minor chord progression. A trumpet is playing a loud melody alongside the guitar. All the instruments sound flat and are being played by a keyboard. There are little bongo hits in the background panned to the left side of the speakers. Apart from the music you can hear eating sounds and a stomach rumbling. This song may be playing for an advertisement.   \n",

The strumming is fast. The melody is played on one fretted string and other open strings. The melody is played on the lower octave and is later repeated on the higher octave.
